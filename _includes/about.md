Hi — I am a software developer on Google's Access and Energy team, and an alum of Washington University in St. Louis.

I'm excited about web development, UI design, tools for understanding and visualizing data, and WebGL. More specifically, I want to create solutions for environmental and humanitarian issues. Let's build something.
