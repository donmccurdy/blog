title: Getting Involved in Open Source Software
---

*Where to find projects that need help, and how to contribute.*

I’ll start by saying that I am not so much writing this as someone who is prolifically involved in the open source community as someone who is *getting better* and finding enjoyable ways to contribute, which is probably more important.

## Finding New Projects

Chances are, at least some of the software you use is open source. This is almost always the easiest place to get started. Look around on GitHub (or wherever) and see what you find in their issue trackers. If you get stuck using a framework and trying to do something that seems like it should be simple, consider writing up some documentation for the next person.

But ok, maybe the software you use most often is 100% proprietary: sorry about that. Now what? There are several websites that make it easy to find ways to contribute, whether you’re a developer, designer, or just getting started.

1. [Up For Grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net): A curated list of projects looking for help, specifically designed for new contributors. The list includes basic tagging, so you can filter for projects in whichever programming language you prefer.
2. [Civic Tech Issue Finder](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues): Code for America organizes a number of open source projects aiming to (1) make government services more effective and (2) give people more input and insight within their cities.
3. [CodeTriage](http://www.codetriage.com/): Less of an exploratory tool than a motivational helper, CodeTriage will send you an email a day about open issues on projects you choose. The site features more large frameworks than small projects, which may or may not be what you want.
4. Join a mailing list: WDRL [LINK] is my favorite for anything web-related, but there are mailing lists for pretty much everything. Avoid lists that post more than once a week, unless there’s a digest option. Once a week is plenty.


## Ways to Help

1. **Fix bugs**: Contributing fixes is a great way to get a better idea of how a project works, and you’ll often learn tricks along the way. Don’t let yourself get stuck for too long though — sometimes bugs are unfixed for a reason.
2. **Find and Document Bugs**: If you find a problem, let someone know! Better yet, explain clearly how to recreate the problem (honestly, reproducing someone else’s situation often me takes longer than actually fixing it). Include enough of your code to understand what you are trying to do. If that’s a lot, try to trim that down to the smallest snippet that still shows the problem.
3. **Add a Test**: After you’ve found or fixed a bug is a *great* time to write a test so that it doesn’t happen again. 
4. **Add a Feature** (*carefully*): Adding a new feature and seeing it be used by others is a great feeling. It’s a good idea to ask the project owner (by opening an issue) whether or not they’d be open to having that feature, though. Ultimately they’re the ones who will have to keep it from breaking as the project evolves, so having a conversation about it first will almost always save time.
5. **Translation**: Translating content isn’t always easy for the developers/designers working on a project. If you’re able to help with this, please do!
6. **Documentation**: Everyone needs documentation. You're almost never the first person who has had trouble figuring out something that seems simple in retrospect. Making sure these situations are well-documented benefits any growing project.

## Things to Remember

Don’t jump into a project without at least checking that it’s alive. Look for recent commits, the number of stars on GitHub, and whether there are other pull requests that have been ignored without being closed or commented on.

Owners will frequently ask you to make a couple changes before they merge your code. It’s also normal that they will have strong opinions about what is “within the scope” of their project. If you’re going to try a new feature, ask the owner for input before you start. Most importantly, changes that would require other users of the project to change their own code are *always* up to the project's owner.
