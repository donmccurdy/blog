title: Using an iPhone with Google Cardboard
---

I haven't heard much about iPhone users trying Google Cardboard, so this post is basically my way of saying "Yep, it works." 

And yeah. It does, assuming you have a large enough screen for a convincing field of view. iPhone 5/5S/6/6+ will be fine. iPhone 4/4S, probably not.

## What You'll Need

A $25 Google Cardboard kit, or the materials to make one. If you decide to buy, [DODOcase](http://www.dodocase.com/products/google-cardboard-vr-goggle-toolkit) is a good option because they (1) explicitly fit iPhone 6/6+ and (2) include a little cardboard spacer to help with the 5/5S.

If you'd rather make things yourself, start with [Google's instructions](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/get-cardboard.html#build-it).

* The lenses (biconvex, 45mm focal distance) are the least convenient part, and they're currently $2 on eBay or $10 on Amazon.
* Skip the NFC tag. It won't do anything on the iPhone 6/6+ yet (just Apple reasons), and won't do anything on the iPhone 5/5S *ever* (no NFC chip).

## VR Demos and Games

I wish there were more options in the App Store, but so far it's a bit limited. My favorites so far:

1. [VRSE.com](http://vrse.com/) — Selection of VR films from Sundance Film Festival. Each film is a 1GB download, but they're also the best looking VR films you're going to find right now.
2. [Volvo Reality](http://www.volvocars.com/us/about/our-stories/google-cardboard) — Okay, it might be an ad for the Volvo XC90. Whatever. The scenery is pretty, and presumably more content will be coming out episodically.

You can also find WebVR (WebGL-based VR sites) online, most of which should work equally well on iOS or Android. Google posted several interesting examples on the [Chrome Experiments](http://vr.chromeexperiments.com/) site.
