title: Creating a Map with WebGL and THREE.js
---

Web mapping applications tend to use some combination of JavaScript, SVG, Flash, and WebGL to render a smoothly animated map. WebGL is the newest and most powerful, but it also isn't supported on older browsers. Because of that, applications are built to be able to work without it, but to take advantage of it when WebGL is supported. WebGL can do a lot of things that would be impossible (or just *really* slow) with older technology, so it's a fun option if you're building something experimental or just really want to abandon older browsers for the sake of visual effects.

In this post I'm going to walk through how you might create a very simple world map using WebGL and THREE.js. No street names, satellite imagery, or turn-by-turn directions — just a basic world map with countries marked in different colors, a few click events, pan/zoom/rotate controls, and some cute 3D trees for good measure.
