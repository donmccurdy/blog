title: Wanting to Change the World

A lot of small things combined to get me interested in software development. "Needing" my own website as a kid. Making robots with the Lego Mindstorms RIS 1.0. Video games, mods, and trying to make Windows ME work the way I wanted (this went poorly).

Despite all of that, I would never have chosen to study computer science in college, or to become a full-time software engineer, if it hadn't been for two things. (1) I had a really wonderful first-year CSE course at WUSTL. (2) Coding is relevant to an incredible range of problems â€” scientific research, medicine, government, economic development, education, consumer technology. Practically everything. This isn't to say that technology can solve every social challenge, or even most of them. But it certainly has a role to play, from [making government more efficient](http://www.codeforamerica.org/) to analyzing the effectiveness of [microloans in the developing world](http://www.kiva.org/). People everywhere have needs, questions, and advice to offer: information must move in all directions, and how to do that is often an unsolved problem when it comes to well-designed interactions with larger organizations and with technology.

Two applications that interest me in particular are improving opportunities for those in developing countries and environmental action and policy (which are [not entirely unrelated](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/27/climate-change-poor-countries-ipcc)).

In practice, what I have found is that whatever the potential may be, ways to get meaningfully involved in any sort of nonprofit work as a software developer or designer are limited, at best. I'd love to hear from someone who knows more about this, but I'll offer some conjuctures:

1. From the perspective of donors and the budget, designers and developers are "overhead" in ways that aid workers are not.
2. Positions with broad technical requirements are often classified as I.T. roles, rather than as Software Engineer or Developer positions. To developers early in their careers, for whom the alternatives to nonprofit work are startups and tech companies, this is scary. It implies a shift in career direction that may be difficult to undo later.
3. "Fail fast, fail often" is difficult to achive, in the nonprofit world.
4. Those responsible for hiring are comfortable evaluating technical hires than their peers in the tech world. This makes sense, as NGOs are rarely engineering-driven, but means that hiring is based on the same kinds of criteria one would use to evaluate a contractor: experience, portfolio, and familiarity with the preferred technology. These are often difficult to achieve for developers inside a larger organization, who may be very capable fo learning new technology but have little opportunity to build a portfolio.
