title: Wanting to Change the World

A lot of small things combined to get me interested in software development. "Needing" my own website as a kid. Making robots with the Lego Mindstorms RIS 1.0. Video games, mods, and trying to make Windows ME work the way I wanted (this went poorly).

Despite all of that, I would never have chosen to study computer science in college, or to become a full-time software engineer, if it hadn't been for two things. (1) I had a really wonderful first-year CSE course at WUSTL. (2) Coding is relevant to an incredible range of problems â€” scientific research, medicine, government, economic development, education, consumer technology. Practically everything. This isn't to say that technology can solve every social challenge, or even most of them. But it certainly has a role to play, from [making government more efficient](http://www.codeforamerica.org/) to analyzing the effectiveness of [microloans in the developing world](http://www.kiva.org/). People everywhere have needs, questions, and advice to offer: information must move in all directions, and how to do that is often an unsolved problem when it comes to well-designed interactions with larger organizations and with technology.

Two applications that interest me in particular are improving opportunities for those in developing countries and environmental action and policy (which are [not entirely unrelated](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/27/climate-change-poor-countries-ipcc)).

In practice, what I have found is that whatever the potential may be, ways to get meaningfully involved in any sort of nonprofit work as a software developer or designer are limited, at best. I'd love to hear from someone who knows more about this, but I'll offer some conjucture:

1. From the perspective of donors and the budget, designers and developers overhead, in ways that aid workers are not.
