title: Wanting to Change the World
---

For me, the road to full-time software development began with web design (`<frame/>` + `<table/>` *all the things!*) and building robots with the LEGO Mindstorms RIS 1.0. Software began to feel like a real career option in college, where I enjoyed a wonderful introduction to computer science at WUSTL and later encountered more compelling problems than I'd ever expected to find outside of, say, discovering a cure for cancer.

~~Coding is relevant to an incredible range of problems — scientific research, medicine, government, economic development, education, consumer technology. Practically everything.~~

Two applications that interest me in particular are creating (1) opportunities for those in developing countries and (2) environmental action and policy to prevent climate change. Arguably, economic development and climate change are [not entirely unrelated](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/27/climate-change-poor-countries-ipcc).

~~This isn't to say that technology can solve every social challenge, or even most of them. But it certainly has a role to play, from [making government programs more effective](http://www.codeforamerica.org/) to [coordinating microloans](http://www.kiva.org/) and analyzing their effectiveness of in the developing world.~~

In practice, what I have found is that ways to get meaningfully involved in any sort of nonprofit work as a software developer or designer are very limited. I'd love to hear from someone who knows more about this, but I'll offer some possible reasons:

1. From the perspective of donors and the budget, designers and developers are considered overhead, in ways that aid workers are not.
2. Positions with broad technical requirements are often classified as I.T. roles, rather than as Software Engineer or Developer positions. To developers early in their careers, like me, this is scary. These roles imply a shift in skillsets and career direction that may be difficult to change later.
3. NGOs are rarely engineering-driven, and so hiring is based on the criteria one might use to evaluate a contractor: portfolio, references, and past experience with the preferred technology. These are often difficult to achieve for developers inside a larger organization, who may be quick to learn new technology but have had little opportunity to build a portfolio. Side-projects and open source contributions, both good indicators to tech companies, may be difficult for a non-technical hiring manager to assess.

~~To expand on #2, the potential career shift from traditional software engineering is not the only reason that a supporting technical role (I.T., web site maintenance) might be less appealing to a SWE than a role focused on directly addressing the problems themselves. The median salary for software developers grew from $79,500 USD in 2004 to $92,660 USD in 2013 [[1](#citations)]. The highest paid SWEs earn significantly more, at $143,540 USD, and the argument could be made that the nonprofit sector would benefit more from the donations of, and perhaps professional consulting from, those with high-paying jobs in the technology and financial industries [[2](#citations)].~~

~~This argument is imperfect — what one *could* do is not the same as what one *will* do, in practice — but it is persuasive enough to merit consideration. Or, perhaps, to recommend a strong preference for roles that actively solve a problem more than they fill a gap. Furthermore, it is a good baseline for the type of job that can keep employees motivated by their work and interested in improving. Both are worth looking for in any workplace.~~
