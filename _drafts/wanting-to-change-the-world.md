title: Wanting to Change the World
---

For me, the road to full-time software development began with web design (`<frame/>` and `<table/>` *all the things!*) and building robots with the LEGO Mindstorms RIS 1.0. Eventually, I began to consider it a long-term possibility after a few excellent introductory courses at WUSTL, and being exposed to more realistic applications, and realizing how many areas of work there are to which software is now relevant.

I am thankful for this range of possible applications, but the ability to choose where I spend my time (even without needing to worry too much about income) comes with a certain responsibility to do things that matter. This is a great and humbling problem to have, but finding compelling and important problems to solve has been much harder than simply finding a way to earn a living.

You should have your own ideas of what that means, and I hope that you do, but for me developing countries — along with OECD trends and policies, as far as they affect the rest of the world — are critically important. There are no quick returns here — impact is difficult to measure, policies change slowly, and even successful ideas may take years to look like anything.

Most of my comments are directed at the non-profit sector, because that is where I've spent the most time looking for opportunities to get involved. To be clear, non-profits certainly do not have exclusive rights to achieving valuable results. There are companies that inherently create obvious value for society, and others that run very effective [CSR](#) programs at their own expense.

In practice, ways to get meaningfully involved in any sort of nonprofit work as a software developer or designer are very limited. I'd love to hear from someone who knows more about this, but I'll offer some possible reasons:

- **Cost:** From the perspective of donors and the budget, developers are considered overhead, to an extent that aid workers are not. This may be a result of unrealistic wage expectations on developers' parts, but regardless there are few full-time positions (at any salary) listed.

- **Unclear Responsibilities:** Technical vacancies are often classified I.T. roles, rather than as Software Engineer or Developer positions. To developers early in their careers, like me, this is scary. These roles imply a shift in skillsets and career direction that may not how an engineer feels that he/she can make the most impact. This seems to be especially true of UN organizations.

- **Hiring Good Engineers is Difficult:** NGOs are rarely engineering-driven, and so hiring is based on the criteria one might use to evaluate a contractor: portfolio, references, and past experience with the preferred technology. These are often difficult to achieve for developers inside a larger organization, who may be quick to learn new technology but have had little opportunity to build a portfolio. Side-projects and open source contributions, both good indicators to tech companies, may be difficult for a non-technical hiring manager to assess.

~~To expand on #2, the potential career shift from traditional software engineering is not the only reason that a supporting technical role (I.T., web site maintenance) might be less appealing to a SWE than a role focused on directly addressing the problems themselves. The median salary for software developers grew from $79,500 USD in 2004 to $92,660 USD in 2013 [[1](#citations)]. The highest paid SWEs earn significantly more, at $143,540 USD, and the argument could be made that the nonprofit sector would benefit more from the donations of, and perhaps professional consulting from, those with high-paying jobs in the technology and financial industries [[2](#citations)].~~

~~This argument is imperfect — what one *could* do is not the same as what one *will* do, in practice — but it is persuasive enough to merit consideration. Or, perhaps, to recommend a strong preference for roles that actively solve a problem more than they fill a gap. Furthermore, it is a good baseline for the type of job that can keep employees motivated by their work and interested in improving. Both are worth looking for in any workplace.~~

~~Two applications that interest me in particular are creating (1) opportunities for those in developing countries and (2) environmental action and policy to prevent climate change. Arguably, economic development and climate change are [not entirely unrelated](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/27/climate-change-poor-countries-ipcc).~~
