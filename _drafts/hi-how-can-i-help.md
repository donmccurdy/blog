title: Hi, How Can I Help?
subtitle: What happens to developers who want to join non-profits.

For me, the road to full-time software development began with web design (`<frame/>` and `<table/>` *all the things!*) and building robots with the LEGO Mindstorms RIS 1.0. Much later, I found myself considering tech as a long-term possibility after a few excellent introductory courses at WUSTL, exposure to more realistic applications, and realizing how many fields there are to which software is relevant. The upside to this optionality is the ability to choose projects that matter, which is an exciting and humbling problem to have.

The tech industry is not known for focusing on serious problems, and (with some key exemptions for [taco-delivering drones](http://tacocopter.com/)) really should do better. You will, I hope, have your own idea of what problems matter most. For me, developing countries — and the ways in which the policies of OECD nations affect them — are critically important.

In practice, ways to get meaningfully involved in any sort of nonprofit work as a software developer or designer are very limited. I'd love to hear from others about this, but based on several years of watching job listings, bouncing in and out of mailing lists, and Google queries of increasing cyclomatic complexity, I'll offer some of my assumptions and fears:

- **Cost:** For managers needing to be conscious of donors and bucketed funding, developers are overhead to an extent that other employees are not. This may be a result of unrealistic wage expectations on developers' parts, but regardless there are few full-time positions (at any salary) listed.

- **Unclear Responsibilities:** Technical vacancies are often classified as I.T. roles, rather than as Software Engineer or Developer positions. Or, the job posting describes maintaining an existing site or blog, but very little else. To developers early in their careers, like me, this is scary. These roles imply a shift in skillsets and career direction that may not reflect how an engineer feels that he/she can make the most impact.

- **Hiring Good Engineers is Difficult:** NGOs are rarely engineering-driven, and so hiring is based on the criteria one might use to evaluate a contractor: portfolio, references, and past experience with the preferred technology. These are often difficult to achieve for developers inside a larger organization, who may be quick to learn new tools but have little opportunity to build a portfolio. Side-projects and open source contributions, both outstanding indicators to tech companies, may be difficult for a non-technical hiring manager to assess.

These comments are directed at the non-profit sector, because that is where I've spent the most time looking for opportunities to get involved. To be clear, non-profits certainly do not have exclusive rights to achieving valuable results. There are companies that inherently create obvious value for society, and others that run very effective [CSR](#) programs at their own expense.

After quite a lot of searching for vacancies with non-profits, research organizations, as well as governmental and inter-governmental programs, I was able to come up with a few organizations and positions that seemed to do a good job leveraging data and technology. The list was not long.

It's also possible that as a developer, I'm misrepresenting the needs and challenges of the non-profit sector. These are just my opinions, but there don't seem to be many resources talking about the problem, other than frequent complaints that the tech world is out of touch, building pointless apps, or mainly concerned with [convincing people to click ads](#citations) [1].

~~After all of this, I ended up with a lucky break and am now working on a project that matches my criteria extremely well.~~

## Dropped

~~I'm thankful for the freedom to make those choices, and lucky that developers are usually paid well.~~

~~There are no quick returns here: impact is difficult to measure, policies change slowly, and even successful ideas may take years to look like anything.~~

~~Regardless, I still hope to see greater intersection between the tech industry, non-profits, and environmental organizations, and am interested in what it will take (on all sides) to make that happen.~~
