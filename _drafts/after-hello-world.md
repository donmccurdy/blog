title: After Hello World
---

Just out of college. Finishing a code bootcamp. Trying to change careers. I’ve talked to so many people who are just getting started in software development. And I am one. We're not out of place at a tech event, but usually feel like we are.

Our questions: “What next?” I’ve done my obligatory Hello World time, now what do I need to know to get a job? Which jobs are going to help me learn, and which will overwhelm me? Should I be worried about specializing, or going for breadth?

[... smooth transition ...]

Even as I finished an M.S. in computer science, I was asking myself most of these questions. I was worried about going into my first job a bright-eyed generalist and coming out five years later with a resume covered in obscure buzzwords. Worried that by the time I was good at anything, I’d be too specialized to work on things I cared about. And I didn’t know what was worth learning in depth, because honestly who does know what they want to do with their life. I’m still working on that.

One thing I did get right, I think, was starting off at a smaller company [1]. I needed room to make mistakes, but not so much isolation that no one was there to help me learn. My job description was a mess. I wrote CSS, did responsive design, made mockups, built proprietary JS frameworks (please don’t do this), refactored vast tracts of server-side code, built a compiler, packaged VMs, built database access layers for 4+ DB technologies, and spent my weekends trying to learn WebGL. It was dizzying. Sometimes things broke. I’m really glad I did this.

[... I don’t know where I’m going here ...]

[1] My first full-time job was at a company of 60 people, with a dozen engineers. Perhaps a small but self-sufficient team within a larger company would have been similar. Perhaps an even smaller startup would have been worse. I only have my own story.

[A] I still can’t believe how many of the things I thought were wasting my time, I’ve since become really glad that I understand. That hateful compilers class. Learning to draw. Learning to enjoy writing.
