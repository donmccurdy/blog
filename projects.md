[ProxyControls.js](https://proxy-controls.donmccurdy.com) — Connect input devices from your desktop to your mobile phone with WebRTC. This project provides a set of tools for developers interested in quickly prototyping interactive games/scenes in WebVR using Mozilla's [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) library. Works with [Google Cardboard](http://www.google.com/get/cardboard/), and uses Node.js, WebSockets, WebRTC, and the HTML5 Gamepad API. *2016*.

[TagSelect.js](https://github.com/FindTheBest/TagSelect.js) — Modernized, jQuery-free version of my *Input Tokenizer* project. Uses new HTML5 features to provide native-feeling cursor interactions and copy/paste support, at the expense of compatibility with older browsers. *2015*.

[Powerline.io](https://github.com/donmccurdy/powerline) — *Incomplete*. Web application for managing Twitter lists quickly through a clean and simple interface. The project began out of frustration with available tools for sorting my Twitter contacts by different interests, and has gradually evolved into a full list-management application. *2015*.

## Academic

[GeneAtlas Selection/Query Tool](http://www.geneatlas.org/gene/main.jsp) — While at Washington University in St. Louis, was part of the GeneAtlas project under Dr. Tao Ju. With other members of the GeneAtlas team, we developed processes for collecting gene expression pattern data, visualizing it, and querying against particular genes and regions of interest. My role was focused on developing visualization and exploration tools, for which I built a Java-based web application running on OpenGL bindings. *2012*.

[Convex Hull Demo](https://github.com/donmccurdy/convex-hull) — Illustration of a MergeHull algorithm for the convex hull problem. Think of this as computing the shape that a rubber band would take when stretched around a random cluster of thumbtacks on a board. *2011*.
