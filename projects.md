## Professional

[FindTheBest](http://www.findthebest.com) — As a Senior Software Engineer with FindTheBest, I contribute to building a flexible platform for managing, exploring, and presenting data. Our platform offers tools (designed for non-technical users) to turn arbitrary datasets into fully functional vertical web applications featuring search, filtering, ranking, visualizations, supplementary written content, and interactive calculation forms. Over 1,000 such datasets can be explored through FindTheBest.com and connected websites.

## Personal

[Powerline](https://github.com/donmccurdy/powerline) — *In Progress*. Web application for managing Twitter lists quickly through a clean and simple interface. The project began out of frustration with available tools for sorting my Twitter contacts by different interests, and has gradually evolved into a full list-management application.

[Input Tokenizer](https://github.com/donmccurdy/input-tokenizer) — jQuery plugin that allows a user to type keywords, which will be broken up into tags and displayed similarly to tagging a post on Tumblr or Stack-Overflow.

[TagSelect.js](https://github.com/FindTheBest/TagSelect.js) — Modernized, jQuery-free version of my *Input Tokenizer* project. Uses new HTML5 features to provide native-feeling cursor interactions and copy/paste support, at the expense of compatibility with older browsers.

[ASG.js](https://github.com/FindTheBest/asg.js) — Lightweight autocomplete plugin for jQuery, which supports both local and remote option sources. A variety of other options are available.

[THREE.MapControls](https://github.com/donmccurdy/THREE.MapControls) — Camera controls for THREE.js. Began as a few modifications to THREE.TrackballControls, in order to provide interactions suitable for flat scenes: panning, zooming, and limited rotation.

[Leap Quest](https://github.com/donmccurdy/leap-quest) — *Incomplete*. Brief and ill-advised attempt to build a multiplayer micro-RPG from scratch with THREE.js, Node.js, WebSockets, and the LeapJS API.

## Academic

[GeneAtlas](http://www.geneatlas.org/gene/main.jsp) — While at Washington University in St. Louis, I was lucky enough to become involved in the GeneAtlas project under Dr. Tao Ju. With other members of the GeneAtlas team, we developed processes for collecting gene expression pattern data, visualizing it, and querying against particular genes and regions of interest. My role was focused on developing visualization and exploration tools, for which I built a Java-based web application running on OpenGL bindings.

[Convex Hull](https://github.com/donmccurdy/convex-hull) — Demo of MergeHull algorithm for the convex hull problem. Think of this as computing the shape that a rubber band would take when stretched around a random cluster of thumbtacks on a board.
