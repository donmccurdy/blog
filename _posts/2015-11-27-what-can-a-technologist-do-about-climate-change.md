From an essay by Bret Victor ([@worrydream](https://twitter.com/worrydream)), on how the tech community "can contribute to tech and/or policy solutions," and why this is important —

> You cannot calibrate your sense of what’s valuable and necessary to the current fashions in your field.

> …

> Climate change is the problem of our time. It’s everyone’s problem, but it’s our responsibility — as people with the incomparable leverage of being able to work magic through technology.

Read the [full essay here](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/). It's excellent. I don't mean to say that there aren't other problems worth your time, but the general state of the tech community suggests we don't value our time or energy highly enough.
