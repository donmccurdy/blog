Software developer at Google, on the Access and Energy team. Currently located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Completed my M.S. in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis.

My interests include web development, tools for understanding and visualizing data, WebGL, and also wind chimes. Specifically, I am passionate about using technology to create better solutions for environmental and humanitarian issues, and I am looking for ways to become more involved in doing so.

For a list of my work and involvement, see the [Projects](/projects) page. If you'd like to get in touch, please email me at [dm@donmccurdy.com](mailto:dm@donmccurdy.com).
